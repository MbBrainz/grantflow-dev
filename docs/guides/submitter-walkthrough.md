# Submitter Walkthrough

This document provides a step-by-step guide for grant applicants to submit proposals, track their status, and manage milestones through GrantFlow.

## Overview

The grant submission process consists of several key steps:
1. **Accessing the Submissions Dashboard**: View your submissions and start new applications
2. **Selecting a Grant Program**: Choose the appropriate grant program and committee
3. **Completing the Application Form**: Fill in project details, milestones, and post-grant plans
4. **Submitting Your Proposal**: Review and submit for committee review

## Step 1: Accessing the Submissions Dashboard

Start by navigating to the **Submissions** section from the main dashboard. Here you'll see an overview of all your grant submissions.

The dashboard displays:
- **Summary Cards**: Total submissions, active submissions, approved submissions, and total funding requested
- **Filter Options**: View Active, All, or Rejected submissions
- **Your Submissions**: List of all your grant applications with their current status

If you haven't submitted any proposals yet, you'll see a message prompting you to create your first submission.

## Step 2: Starting a New Submission

Click the **New Submission** button in the top right corner to begin creating a grant proposal.

### Selecting a Grant Program

The first step is to select the grant program you want to apply for.

**Grant Program Information:**
- **Program Title**: Name and focus area of the grant program
- **Committee**: The committee responsible for reviewing applications
- **Description**: Details about what the program funds
- **Status**: Active programs are available for applications
- **Funding Details**: 
  - Remaining funding available
  - Typical grant size range (e.g., $20k-$80k per grant)
- **Tags**: Relevant keywords and focus areas

**Important Considerations:**
- Some programs may show "Fully Allocated" if all funding has been committed
- Review the grant size range to ensure it matches your funding needs
- Check the tags to ensure your project aligns with the program's focus

Click on a program card to proceed to the application form.

## Step 3: Completing the Application Form

After selecting a grant program, you'll move to Step 2: Complete your grant proposal.

### Application Header

At the top, you'll see:
- **Selected Program**: Confirmation of which program you're applying to, including committee name and available funding
- **Change Program**: Option to go back and select a different program
- **Fill Test Data**: Helper button to populate the form with sample data (for testing)

### Basic Information Section

**Required Fields:**
- **Project Title***: A clear, concise title for your project
- **Short Description***: Brief description (max 500 characters) summarizing your project

### Milestones Section

Each grant application requires you to define one or more milestones that break your project into manageable phases.

**For Each Milestone, Provide:**
- **Milestone Title***: A descriptive name for the milestone
- **Description***: Detailed explanation of the work to be completed
- **Acceptance Criteria***: Specific, measurable conditions that must be met for completion
- **Funding Amount (USD)***: The amount requested for this milestone
- **Due Date**: Target completion date

**Tips for Defining Milestones:**
- Break your project into logical phases with clear deliverables
- Ensure acceptance criteria are specific and measurable
- Align funding amounts with the work scope
- Set realistic due dates based on your team's capacity

You can add multiple milestones by clicking **Add Another Milestone**. Each milestone will be reviewed separately once your proposal is approved.

### Post-Grant Development Plan

Beyond the grant period, describe your long-term vision for project sustainability.

**Include Information About:**
- **Sustainability**: How the project will be maintained and funded long-term
- **Community Building**: Plans for engaging users and developers
- **Future Development**: Next steps and growth strategies
- **Revenue Models**: If applicable, how the project will generate revenue
- **Additional Funding**: Plans for future fundraising rounds

This section helps reviewers understand your commitment to the project beyond the grant period.

## Step 4: Saving and Submitting

Throughout the application process, you can save your progress as a draft to complete later.

**Before Submitting:**
1. Review all milestones for accuracy and completeness
2. Ensure acceptance criteria are clear and achievable
3. Verify funding amounts total appropriately
4. Check that all required fields are filled
5. Review your post-grant development plan

**When Ready:**
- Click **Save Draft** to save your progress without submitting
- Click **Submit Proposal** to submit your application for committee review

Once submitted, your proposal enters the review queue and cannot be edited (though you can provide updates through discussions).

## Step 5: Tracking Your Submission

After submitting, return to the Submissions Dashboard to view your proposal's status.
