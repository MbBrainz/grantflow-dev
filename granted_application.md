# 📝 GrantFlow.dev

## 🌟 Project Overview

- **Tagline:** Streamlining Polkadot bounty grants from submission to payout in one unified web3 platform.
- **Brief Description:** GrantFlow.dev is an all-in-one platform that consolidates grant submissions, reviews, approvals, and payouts for Polkadot bounty programs. It replaces scattered channels (e.g., GitHub, Discord, Google Docs) with structured forms, real-time tracking, collaborative dashboards, integrated chat features for committees and grantees, and smart contract integrations for efficient, transparent processes.
- **Relation to Polkadot:** The platform integrates directly with Polkadot's ecosystem by handling chain integrations via multi-sig wallets for approvals and authentications, bounty precompiles for automatic payouts, and web3-based authentication. It supports committees like Fast-Grants, UX Bounty, OG Rust, Infrastructure Builders, and DeFi Infrastructure, enhancing bounty management on Polkadot/Substrate chains.
- **Why Interested:** As a developer passionate about web3 efficiency, I built the POC during a hackathon and see huge potential to reduce administrative burdens in Polkadot's grant ecosystem, making it easier for teams to contribute and committees to operate effectively.

### 🔍 Project Details

- **Technology Stack:** Next.js 15 (TypeScript), Vercel AI SDK for optional AI tasks (e.g., initial feedback, codebase guidance), Drizzle ORM for TypeScript-first database schema, PostgreSQL (Supabase) for storage, Octokit.js for GitHub integration (reading proposals, commenting via GitHub App), and web3 libraries for Polkadot multi-sig, chain integrations, and wallet authentication.
- **Documentation of Core Components:** Core architecture includes: (1) Submission forms with cache-based drafts and web3 wallet verification; (2) Dashboard for curators with voting systems, on-chain multi-sig approvals, and integrated chat for committees/grantees; (3) automatic payouts on granted milestones through multisig; (4) Public views for transparency (e.g., submission status, voting history). Protocols ensure immutable records on-chain, with Polkadot chain handling for all multisig and auth processes.
- **POC/MVP or Prior Work:** A hackathon POC exists with basic features: account creation/management, grant application forms, approvals, and milestone submissions (currently buggy). Link: https://github.com/MbBrainz/grantflow-dev.
- **Mockups/Designs of UI Components:** UI includes a unified dashboard for submissions/reviews, structured forms for deliverables (e.g., code uploads, repo links), real-time status trackers, and integrated chat interfaces for committees and grantees. Screenshots are provided here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1H0EpDFICjO5n5ACsVO_tvKXcZOxniEsS?usp=drive_link
- **Data Models/API Specifications:** Data models (via Drizzle ORM) include schemas for grants (exec summary, milestones, wallets), submissions (proof files, repo links, states like "awaiting review"), approvals (votes, multi-sig tx), and chat logs. APIs: REST endpoints for form submissions (integrating GitHub PRs), web3 auth/multisig chain integrations, on-chain queries for status/payouts, and real-time chat endpoints.
- **What It's Not:** The platform will not handle non-Polkadot chains initially, nor will it provide full AI automation of decisions (AI is optional for assistance only). It focuses on Polkadot-specific integrations via multisig and auth.

### 🧩 Ecosystem Fit

- **Fit into Ecosystem:** GrantFlow.dev fits as a tooling layer for Polkadot's bounty programs, integrating with existing repos (e.g., Fast-Grants apply/delivery) and on-chain mechanisms to streamline workflows for committees and grantees.
- **Target Audience:** Polkadot bounty committees (e.g., Fast-Grants, UX Bounty) as curators, and grantees (teams/builders) submitting work.
- **Needs Met:** It addresses inefficiencies in tracking submissions, coordinating reviews, and processing payouts, reducing manual work, errors in milestone assessments (e.g., evaluating code contributions), and delays. Benefits include faster reviews, transparent processes, instant on-chain payouts via Polkadot multisig integrations, and integrated chat for seamless communication, saving time for committees.
- **Similar Projects:** Similar tools exist like bounties.usepapi.app (listing active bounties) or general grant platforms, as well as earn.superteam.fun in EVM and Solana ecosystems, but none provide end-to-end submission-to-payout with on-chain multi-sig, AI-assisted reviews, and integrated chat tailored to Polkadot. Our project differs by focusing on unified, web3-native flows with chat features, emphasizing transparency, committee onboarding, and specific optimizations for Polkadot bounty committees' grant processes. If none exist yet in Polkadot, it's likely due to the niche focus on its fragmented bounty workflows.

### Team's experience

After my Masters in Computational Science I directly started working in web3 full time. First as smart-contract dev (CosmWasm, Rust), then as team lead for fortytwo.money (currently discontinued). Those last 3 years I've worked with all major web frameworks for web2, Next.js, shadcn, PostgreSQL etc, and for web3, ethers.js, wagmi, CosmJS, JSON-RPC, etc. The last iteration of FortyTwo.money, 42agents.ai, was a SaaS platform to manage the configuration of AI customer support, operative in Discord. This platform was fully developed by my colleague Dylan Brudo and me.

Alongside fortytwo, I've been working on a Telegram application called [MissionMate](https://missionmate.team), which is a Telegram community engagement app that acts like a virtual coach inside your Telegram group chats. It started as something fun, but I'm now commercializing it. I don't have experience with Polkadot specifically, but I'm looking forward to gaining that during this project.

## 📊 Development Status

Development has started with a hackathon POC implementing core features: account creation, grant forms, approvals, and milestone submissions (buggy but functional). Code link: https://github.com/MbBrainz/grantflow-dev. Prior research includes analyzing Polkadot grant processes (e.g., Web3 Foundation docs, Fast-Grants repo, interviews with committee members like sachalansky) and tech explorations for GitHub/Polkadot integrations, including multisig and auth.

## 🔮 Future Plans

- **Continuation After Fast-Grant:** Maintain the platform with bug fixes and updates for at least 6 months, evolving based on user feedback, including chat and integration enhancements.
- **Additional Funding Plans:** Explore Web3 Foundation grants for expansions, potential SaaS business model, or community funding via DAOs.
- **Vision for Growth:** Aim for widespread adoption by all Polkadot committees, expanding to more ecosystems, and turning it into a key tool for efficient, transparent web3 grants with robust chat and Polkadot chain features, potentially as a SaaS or open-source project under Web3 Foundation.

## ℹ️ Additional Information

- **Work Already Done:** Hackathon POC with core features; initial research on Polkadot grant processes.
- **Other Contributors:** None currently; open to collaborations.
- **Other Funding:** No other applications yet; this is the first step toward sustainable growth. The platform's benefits for Polkadot committees include reduced review times, error-free assessments, seamless chat communication, and seamless on-chain payouts via multisig integrations, fostering more ecosystem contributions. Note: Requesting full $10,000 USD payout without DOT lockup, based on project needs and alignment with grant guidelines (open to committee feedback on feasibility).
