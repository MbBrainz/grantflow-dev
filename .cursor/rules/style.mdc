When writing typescript code:
- console.log should always have a string literal that starts with "[funtion_name]:" and some indicative words, and then the relevant parameters in the string literal using ${param}. Incase of an object, please use JSON.stringify(param, null, 2)% 
- logg errors the following way: logger.error(error, "message")
