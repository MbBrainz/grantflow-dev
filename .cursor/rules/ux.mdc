UX is extremely important. When a user performs an action like clicking a button, there must ALWAYS be clear and simple user feedback:
good UX example scenario:
1. user fills in form.
2. user clicks submit
3. button disabled immediately
4. button shows a loader to infomr user
5. succesful submit shows toast and redirect

The user needs to know whats going on.
