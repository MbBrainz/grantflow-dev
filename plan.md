# GrantFlow Marketplace ‚Äì Project Plan

## 1. Current Status ‚úÖ

### MVP Platform Ready

The GrantFlow platform has been successfully transformed from a SaaS template to a clean grant platform MVP:

- **‚úÖ Clean Architecture:** All SaaS template backwards compatibility removed
- **‚úÖ Grant-First Design:** Database schema optimized for committees and submissions
- **‚úÖ Build Success:** All TypeScript compilation errors resolved
- **‚úÖ Multi-Committee Foundation:** Ready for marketplace implementation
- **‚úÖ Milestone Completion:** Committee members can complete milestones with multisig transaction verification

### Recently Completed (January 2025)

- **‚úÖ Backwards Compatibility Removal:** Eliminated all team/SaaS template code
- **‚úÖ Database Schema Cleanup:** Removed unused tables (teams, teamMembers, activityLogs, invitations)
- **‚úÖ Query Optimization:** Updated all database queries for grant platform
- **‚úÖ Component Updates:** Modernized UI components for grant workflow
- **‚úÖ Build Verification:** All 22 pages building successfully
- **‚úÖ Milestone Multisig Completion:** Added ability for committee members to mark milestones complete with transaction verification
- **‚úÖ Homepage Redesign:** Transformed generic SaaS template into exciting grant platform landing page with two-sided marketplace messaging, gradient designs, and clear value propositions for both committees and grantee teams
- **‚úÖ Lottie Animation Integration:** Replaced static Terminal component with dynamic Lottie animation system using lottie-react, including proper loading states, error handling, and static asset management
- **‚úÖ Submission Detail UX Redesign:** Completely redesigned submission detail page with prominent "Active Step Hero" component that shows current stage (approval/milestone) with relevant chat and actionable interface - no more vague status cards
- **‚úÖ Role-Based Views Implementation:** Complete role-based routing system with specialized views for Curator (voting, workflow, analytics), Grantee (progress tracking, response interface), and Public (transparency, accountability) - each user sees exactly what they need
- **‚úÖ Committee Context & Membership:** Curators can now see which committee a submission belongs to and all their committee memberships. Added CommitteeInfoCard showing focus areas, voting thresholds, and membership status. Added CuratorCommitteesDropdown for switching between committee contexts. Enhanced UserContext with committee role detection.
- **‚úÖ UX Bug Fixes & Improvements:** Fixed voting status bug where "Vote Required" showed even after voting. Simplified committee display in submission detail to show only relevant committee. Added committee badges and milestone progress indicators (like "3/5") to submission lists for better overview and context.
- **‚úÖ Curator Priority Actions Dashboard:** Added dedicated "My Actions Required" section to curator dashboard showing all submissions and milestones specifically awaiting the current curator's response/approval with direct clickable links. Features urgency indicators (critical 14+ days, urgent 7+ days) and clear action types (submission votes vs milestone reviews). Includes smart filtering to only show items where curator hasn't voted/reviewed yet.
- **‚úÖ Enhanced Milestone Status & Removed Private Discussions:** Replaced generic "review in progress" information with detailed milestone-specific status showing current active step (e.g., "building milestone 1", "milestone 2 under review"). Added comprehensive MilestoneStatusOverview component with progress tracking, status indicators, and action-required badges. Removed private curator discussions to streamline the review process - all communication now happens in public threads for transparency.
- **‚úÖ PostgreSQL Schema Error Fix:** Resolved critical `column milestones.reviewer_group_id does not exist` error that was preventing the Review Dashboard from loading. Fixed Drizzle ORM relation confusion by adding explicit relation names in schema (`milestoneGroup`) and refactoring complex subqueries in `getAllSubmissionsForReview()` and `getReviewerPendingActions()` functions. Review Dashboard now loads successfully with proper statistics and submission data.
- **‚úÖ Discussion Permission Bug Fix:** Fixed critical permission logic bug in `DiscussionThread` component where `isPublic={true}` was incorrectly preventing authenticated users from posting messages. Updated permission logic to allow posting when discussion is public OR user has reviewer/submission owner permissions. Enhanced component to accept `submissionContext` for more sophisticated permission checking.

## Terminology Migration Completed

- **‚úÖ Complete Curator ‚Üí Reviewer Migration:** Completely renamed all "curator" references to "reviewer" throughout the entire codebase with NO backwards compatibility. This includes:
  - Database function names (`checkIsCurator` ‚Üí `checkIsReviewer`, etc.)
  - Component names (`CuratorSubmissionView` ‚Üí `ReviewerSubmissionView`)
  - User-facing text ("Curator Dashboard" ‚Üí "Reviewer Dashboard")
  - Route paths (`/dashboard/curator` ‚Üí `/dashboard/review`)
  - Type definitions and interfaces
  - Comments and documentation
  - All legacy wrapper functions have been completely removed

## 1.1 Role-Based Action Sets & UI Flows üÜï **PRIORITY**

### Problem Statement

Current platform shows same view to all users regardless of role, missing differentiated experiences for:

- **Curators** (reviewers/voters) vs **Grantees** (applicants) vs **Public** (transparency seekers)
- Different action capabilities and information needs per role
- Missing public transparency layer for non-authenticated users

### Action Set Definitions

#### **Curator Actions** (Authenticated + Role: curator)

**Primary Goals:** Review, vote, provide feedback, manage approval workflow

- **VOTE** on submission approval/rejection with reasoning
- **DISCUSS** in curator-only threads and public threads
- **REQUEST CHANGES** with specific feedback requirements
- **REVIEW MILESTONES** and approve/reject milestone submissions
- **TRIGGER PAYOUTS** via multisig transaction initiation
- **MANAGE WORKFLOW** (set status, escalate, assign reviewers)
- **VIEW ANALYTICS** (committee performance, review queue stats)
- **EXPORT REPORTS** for committee governance

#### **Grantee Actions** (Authenticated + Role: grantee + submission owner)

**Primary Goals:** Track progress, respond to feedback, submit deliverables

- **TRACK STATUS** of application through approval pipeline
- **RESPOND TO FEEDBACK** from curators with clarifications
- **SUBMIT MILESTONE UPDATES** with GitHub links and deliverables
- **PARTICIPATE IN DISCUSSIONS** (read-only curator threads, respond in public)
- **EDIT SUBMISSIONS** during draft or "changes requested" phase
- **VIEW PAYMENT STATUS** and transaction history
- **APPEAL DECISIONS** through structured feedback mechanism

#### **Public View Actions** (Non-authenticated or other users)

**Primary Goals:** Transparency, learning, potential future application

- **VIEW SUBMISSION STATUS** and approval timeline
- **READ PUBLIC DISCUSSIONS** and voting rationale (read-only)
- **BROWSE COMMITTEE ACTIVITY** and success rates
- **VIEW MILESTONE PROGRESS** and deliverables (public transparency)
- **LEARN FROM EXAMPLES** of successful/rejected applications
- **NO SENSITIVE INFO** (no private votes, internal deliberations, or personal data)

interface UserContext {
  user: User | null
  isAuthenticated: boolean
  role: 'curator' | 'grantee' | 'admin' | null

  // Submission-specific permissions
  isSubmissionOwner: boolean
  isCommitteeCurator: boolean
  canVote: boolean
  canEditSubmission: boolean
  canViewPrivateDiscussions: boolean
}
```

#### **Component Architecture**

```
SubmissionDetailView (Router)
‚îú‚îÄ CuratorSubmissionView (role: curator)
‚îú‚îÄ GranteeSubmissionView (role: grantee + owner)
‚îú‚îÄ PublicSubmissionView (unauthenticated or other)
‚îî‚îÄ SharedComponents (reused across views)
    ‚îú‚îÄ ProjectOverview
    ‚îú‚îÄ TimelineDisplay
    ‚îú‚îÄ PublicDiscussion
    ‚îî‚îÄ TechnicalDetails
```

### Implementation Priority

#### **Phase 1: Role Detection & Routing** ‚ö° IMMEDIATE

1. **Fix database query error** blocking current active step functionality
2. **Add role-based routing** in SubmissionDetailView component
3. **Create UserContext hook** with submission-specific permissions
4. **Implement basic view switching** (curator vs grantee vs public)

#### **Phase 2: Curator-Focused Interface**

1. **Enhanced voting interface** with approval workflow
2. **Curator-only discussion threads** with moderation tools
3. **Review queue optimization** with filtering and assignment
4. **Committee analytics dashboard** for decision support

#### **Phase 3: Grantee Experience Optimization**

1. **Progress tracking hero** with clear next steps
2. **Simplified response interface** for curator feedback
3. **Milestone submission optimization** with GitHub integration
