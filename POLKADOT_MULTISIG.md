# Polkadot Multisig Integration

## Overview

GrantFlow integrates with Polkadot's on-chain multisig functionality to enable secure, transparent milestone-based grant payments. Committee members collectively approve and execute payments directly from a committee multisig wallet.

## Architecture

### Database Schema

#### `milestone_approvals` Table
Tracks the state of multisig approval processes for milestone payments.

```typescript
{
  id: number
  milestoneId: number          // Links to milestones table
  groupId: number              // Committee that owns this approval
  initiatorId: number          // User who initiated the multisig
  multisigCallHash: string     // On-chain call hash
  multisigCallData: string     // Hex-encoded call data
  timepoint: {                 // Block height & index when initiated
    height: number
    index: number
  }
  status: 'pending' | 'threshold_met' | 'executed' | 'cancelled'
  executionTxHash?: string     // Final execution transaction
  executionBlockNumber?: number
}
```

#### `multisig_signatures` Table
Records individual committee member signatures/votes.

```typescript
{
  id: number
  approvalId: number           // Links to milestone_approvals
  reviewId?: number            // Links to reviews (for merged workflow)
  userId?: number              // User if known
  signatoryAddress: string     // Wallet address
  signatureType: 'signed' | 'rejected'
  txHash: string               // On-chain transaction hash
  isInitiator: boolean         // First vote that published the call
  isFinalApproval: boolean     // Last vote that executed payment
}
```

### MultisigConfig

Committees configure multisig settings in `committee.settings.multisig`:

```typescript
interface MultisigConfig {
  multisigAddress: string                      // On-chain multisig account
  signatories: string[]                        // Committee member wallet addresses
  threshold: number                            // Required approvals (â‰¥2)
  approvalWorkflow: 'merged' | 'separated'    // See workflow patterns below
  requireAllSignatories: boolean               // All must vote vs just threshold
  votingTimeoutBlocks: number                  // Blocks before expiry
  automaticExecution: boolean                  // Auto-execute on threshold
  network: 'polkadot' | 'kusama' | 'paseo'   // Which network
}
```

## Workflow Patterns

### Merged Workflow (Recommended)
**Decision and execution happen together** - when a committee member approves a milestone review, it triggers an on-chain signature.

**Process:**
1. Committee members review milestone off-chain (vote approve/reject)
2. When member votes "approve", they're prompted to connect Polkadot wallet
3. Wallet signature is submitted on-chain via multisig
4. Once threshold is met, payment automatically executes
5. `multisig_signatures.reviewId` links on-chain signature to off-chain review

**Benefits:**
- One-step process for committee members
- Tighter coupling between decision and execution
- More efficient (fewer transactions)

### Separated Workflow
**Two-phase process** - approval decision happens first, then separate blockchain signing step.

**Process:**
1. Committee members review milestone off-chain
2. After milestone is approved by committee, multisig payment is initiated
3. Committee members then separately sign the multisig transaction
4. Once threshold is met, final signatory executes payment

**Benefits:**
- Separation of concerns (decision vs execution)
- More control over timing
- Can review all pending payments before signing

## Components

### Multisig Utilities
Location: `src/lib/polkadot/multisig.ts`

Core functions for interacting with Polkadot multisig pallet.

**Key Functions:**
- `createTransferCall()`: Creates a balance transfer call
- `createBatchedPaymentCall()`: Combines transfer + remark atomically
- `initiateMultisigApproval()`: First signatory publishes call and votes
- `approveMultisigCall()`: Intermediate signatories approve
- `finalizeMultisigCall()`: Final signatory executes payment
- `queryPendingMultisigs()`: Check pending multisig calls

**Note:** These functions are currently stubbed with TODOs. To enable actual blockchain interaction:

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pnpm add polkadot-api @polkadot-api/descriptors
```

2. Generate chain descriptors:
```bash
# See: https://papi.how/recipes/codegen
pnpm dlx @polkadot-api/codegen
```

3. Update `src/lib/polkadot/client.ts` and `src/lib/polkadot/multisig.ts` to use typed API

## Setup Guide

### For Committee Admins

1. **Create Multisig Wallet**
   - Use Polkadot.js Apps or Talisman to create an on-chain multisig
   - Add all committee member wallet addresses as signatories
   - Set threshold (number of required approvals)
   - Note the multisig address

2. **Configure in GrantFlow**
   - Navigate to `/dashboard/committees/[id]/manage`
   - Scroll to "Multisig Account" section
   - Enter multisig address
   - Add all signatory addresses (committee member wallets)
   - Set threshold
   - Choose approval workflow (merged recommended)
   - Select network (Polkadot/Kusama/Paseo)
   - Save configuration

3. **Fund Multisig Wallet**
   - Transfer funds to the multisig address to cover grant payments
   - Ensure sufficient balance for transaction fees

### For Committee Members

1. **Install Wallet Extension**
   - Install Polkadot.js, Talisman, SubWallet, or Nova Wallet
   - Create/import account
   - Ensure your address is added to committee multisig

2. **Connect Wallet in GrantFlow**
   - Click "Connect Wallet" button in header
   - Select your wallet extension
   - Approve connection
   - Select account that's a multisig signatory

3. **Approve Milestone Payments**
   - Navigate to submission with approved milestone
   - Expand milestone details
   - See "Multisig Approval" section
   - Click "Approve Payment" (or "Initiate Approval" if first)
   - Sign transaction in wallet extension
   - Wait for confirmation
   - View status and other signatories' votes

## Testing on Testnet

### Using Paseo Testnet

1. Set network to 'paseo' in multisig config
2. Create multisig on Paseo network
3. Get test tokens from Paseo faucet
4. Test full workflow without real funds

### Test Checklist

## Security Considerations

1. **Multisig Threshold**: Set threshold high enough to prevent single-point failure but low enough to not block payments
2. **Signatory Management**: Regularly audit signatory list, remove departing members
3. **Wallet Security**: Committee members must secure their wallet private keys
4. **Transaction Verification**: Always verify transaction details before signing
5. **Timeout Handling**: Monitor for expiring multisig calls
6. **Network Selection**: Ensure all committee members use same network
7. **Balance Monitoring**: Keep multisig wallet funded for payments + fees

## Troubleshooting

### "Wallet not detected"
- Ensure wallet extension is installed and enabled
- Refresh page after installing extension
- Check browser console for errors

### "Address not a signatory"
- Verify wallet address matches one in multisig config
- Ensure correct account selected in wallet
- Check multisig configuration in committee settings

### "Transaction failed"
- Check multisig wallet has sufficient balance
- Verify all transaction parameters are correct
- Ensure no conflicting pending multisig calls
- Check network connectivity

### "Threshold not met"
- View signatory vote list to see who hasn't voted
- Contact remaining committee members
- Check if voting timeout has expired
